# Model_Generatif_Image_project
This project is done on the following works:

[Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Huang_Arbitrary_Style_Transfer_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)
[Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)
# project structure
The .py files contain the code with the necessaty methods to do style transfer
The folder saved_models/ contain the necessary models to be loaded
The **demo** on how the code can be used to perform style transfer is in AdaIN.ipynb and Gatys.iypnb
A few content and style samples can be found in content/ and style/ folder
The datasetst used can be downloaded through the links available in Chinese_art_dataset and COCO_test2017_2k


# Credits
Code for Gatys et al. approach was inspired from the authors repo : https://github.com/leongatys/PytorchNeuralStyleTransfer

Code for AdaIN was inspired from the following repo : https://github.com/ziwei-jiang/AdaIN-Style-Transfer-PyTorch/tree/master
