# Model_Generatif_Image_project

This project is a comprehensive comparison of the following works:

- [Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization (Huang et Belongie, 2017)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Huang_Arbitrary_Style_Transfer_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)

- [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks (Gatys et al, 2016)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)


# project structure
The .py files contain the code with the necessary methods to do style transfer

The folder saved_models/contains the necessary models to be loaded

The **demo** on how the code can be used to perform style transfer is in AdaIN.ipynb and Gatys.iypnb

A few content and style samples can be found in content/ and style/ folders

The datasets used can be downloaded through the links available in Chinese_art_dataset and COCO_test2017_2k


# Credits
- The code for Gatys et al. approach was inspired by the authors' repo: https://github.com/leongatys/PytorchNeuralStyleTransfer

- The Code for AdaIN was inspired by the following repo: https://github.com/ziwei-jiang/AdaIN-Style-Transfer-PyTorch/tree/master
